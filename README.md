### Tasfia Shaheba â€” Frontend JavaScript (Quiz Logic and API Integration)

**Setup:**
- Developed `script.js` to control quiz behavior
- Integrated with backend endpoints for starting games, submitting answers, leaderboard, and history
- Used `localStorage` to store username and result summaries
- Handled game session memory, score tracking, and sound effects
- Applied dynamic DOM rendering for quiz flow

**Key Features:**

- `startQuiz()`  
  - Starts a quiz with selected question amount (`/api/start?amount=N`)  
  - Retrieves question amount using `localStorage.getItem("questionAmount")`
  - Initializes 120-second countdown  
  - Stores `gameId` and questions
  - Renamed HTML call to safely use `if (window.startQuiz) window.startQuiz();`  
  - Resolved conflict from double declarations of `startQuiz()`

- `nextQuestion()`  
  - Validates answer selection  
  - Provides feedback with audio and visual cues (Correct! / Wrong!)
  - Displays centered alert boxes that auto-fade
  - Updates DOM elements like question count and category
  - Navigates through questions and scores

- `submitQuiz()`  
  - Sends game data to `/api/submit` including: `gameId`, `userAnswers`, `username`, and `totalQuestions`  
  - Receives and displays `score` and `timeTaken`  
  - Shows friendly "Time's Up!" screen if timer runs out  
  - Stores results in `localStorage` and redirects to `results.html`  
  - Added alerts and error handling if score saving fails

- `showFinalResult()`  
  - Displays score, time, and timestamp  
  - Pulls from `localStorage`

- `startTimer()`  
  - Starts and manages 120s countdown  
  - Auto-submits quiz on timeout  
  - Locks interaction and updates UI

- **UI/UX Improvements:**
  - Connected question amount buttons to script logic instead of relying on missing dropdowns
  - Saved question amount from `quiz.html` using `localStorage.setItem("questionAmount", N)`
  - Improved layout with `centerQuizLayout()` for all screen sizes
  - Cleaned up spacing and alignment for quiz text, buttons, and containers
  - Removed unused/legacy elements and dropdowns
  - Ensured state consistency across screens (quiz â†’ results)
